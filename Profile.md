## Summary
Hello :)
I'm Douglas, a Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience specializing in full-stack development and modern web technologies. My journey spans from frontend to backend architecture, with a strong focus on building scalable, user-centric applications using React, Next.js, React Native, and TypeScript. I excel at creating pixel-perfect interfaces and seamless user experiences while maintaining clean, maintainable code.

My expertise includes comprehensive front-end development with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and advanced React ecosystems, as well as robust backend solutions. I've successfully architected serverless infrastructures leveraging AWS services such as Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, and SES, ensuring scalability and cost-efficiency. Additionally, I integrate Google services like Google Maps API and Google Places to deliver location-based features and real-time functionality.

Currently, I'm a Frontend Developer at Pepperlaw AI, where I led a complete UI restructuring of an AI-generated codebase, transforming it into a pixel-perfect, high-performance application using React. I developed a Word-like editor with Markdown support, comments, and multi-format export capabilities, and integrated WOPI (Web Application Open Platform Interface). This overhaul significantly improved product quality, reduced critical bugs, and directly contributed to securing the startup's first corporate client.

Previously, I've delivered end-to-end solutions including a civic reporting mobile app published on Android and iOS stores, built from requirements gathering to production deployment. I've also developed AI-powered quiz systems using LLMs, implemented automated scheduling algorithms, and integrated Stripe for subscription-based payments with optimized checkout flows.
I consistently apply best practices in SEO optimization, performance tuning (achieving Google PageSpeed scores of 95+), and code quality. My approach combines technical excellence with strategic thinking, always aiming to deliver innovative solutions that solve real-world problems using cutting-edge technologies and modern development methodologies.
